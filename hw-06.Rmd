<!-- 2. Writing functions -->
<!-- Pick one: -->

<!-- Write one (or more) functions that do something useful to pieces of the Gapminder or Singer data. It is logical to think about computing on the mini-data frames corresponding to the data for each specific country, location, year, band, album, … This would pair well with the prompt below about working with a nested data frame, as you could apply your function there. -->
<!-- Make it something you can’t easily do with built-in functions. Make it something that’s not trivial to do with the simple dplyr verbs. The linear regression function presented here is a good starting point. You could generalize that to do quadratic regression (include a squared term) or use robust regression, using MASS::rlm() or robustbase::lmrob(). -->
<!-- If you plan to complete the homework where we build an R package, write a couple of experimental functions exploring some functionality that is useful to you in real life and that might form the basis of your personal package. -->

<!-- 6. Work with a nested data frame -->
<!-- Create a nested data frame and map a function over the list column holding the nested data. Use list extraction or other functions to pull interesting information out of these results and work your way back to a simple data frame you can visualize and explore. -->

<!-- Here’s a fully developed prompt for Gapminder: -->

<!-- See the split-apply-combine lesson from Jenny Bryan -->
<!-- Nest the data by country (and continent). -->
<!-- Fit a model of life expectancy against year. Possibly quadratic, possibly robust (see above prompt re: function writing). -->
<!-- Use functions for working with fitted models or the broom package to get information out of your linear models. -->
<!-- Use the usual dplyr, tidyr, and ggplot2 workflows to explore, e.g., the estimated cofficients. -->
<!-- Inspiration for the modelling and downstream inspiration -->

<!-- Find countries with interesting stories. - Sudden, substantial departures from the temporal trend is interesting. How could you operationalize this notion of “interesting”? -->
<!-- Use the residuals to detect countries where your model is a terrible fit. Examples: Are there are 1 or more freakishly large residuals, in an absolute sense or relative to some estimate of background variability? Are there strong patterns in the sign of the residuals? E.g., all pos, then all neg, then pos again. -->
<!-- Fit a regression using ordinary least squares and a robust technique. Determine the difference in estimated parameters under the two approaches. If it is large, consider that country “interesting”. -->
<!-- Compare a linear and quadratic fit -->
